## Features

üîí **Encrypt Images**: Secure your images with a numeric key. Encrypted files are saved with a `.enc` extension.

üñºÔ∏è **Decrypt Files**: Recover original images from `.enc` files using the same key used during encryption.

üìã **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI to easily select files, set keys, and perform encryption or decryption.

üé® **Interactive Design**: A visually appealing and responsive interface created with `Tkinter`.

‚ö° **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to ensure smooth user experience.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for application logic and GUI development.
- **Tkinter**: Provides the graphical user interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Handles image file operations.

2. **Encrypt an Image**:
   - Click **Select Image** and choose an image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg`).
   - Enter a numeric key in the text box.
   - Click **Encrypt Image** to create an encrypted `.enc` file.

3. **Decrypt a File**:
   - Click **Select Encrypted File** and choose a `.enc` file.
   - Enter the numeric key used during encryption.
   - Click **Decrypt File** to recover the original image.

4. **Ensure Key Consistency**:
   Use the same key for encryption and decryption to avoid errors.
